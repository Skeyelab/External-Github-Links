# External Github Links

> Makes non GitHub.com links open in a new tab.

## Introduction

I made this extension to fix something I find annoying.  When browsing Github, sometime people have non-GIthub.com links in their files.  I want these to always open up in a new tab.

This cross-browser web extension fixes that!

## Installation

The External Github Links is available for [Google Chrome].

For other browsers that support web extensions, you can also [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/Skeyelab/External-Github-Links/archive/master.zip) and select it as a new add-on or extension.
How to do this will differ between the individual browsers.
